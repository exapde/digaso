This repo is a port of the code "DIGASO" code.

Cuong has two repos:
- DIGASO
- DIGASO1.0

DIGASO1.0 contains the latest version of the C++ code, while DIGASO contains the Matlab scripts required for preprocessing and high level interface, as well as several examples that rely on both the Matlab scripts and the C++ code. On the other hand, the DIGASO1.0 code, while having a more recent version of the C++ code, does not have as many examples as DIGASO. This repo is a merger of the Matlab scripts and examples from DIGASO with the updated C++ code in DIGASO1.0.
